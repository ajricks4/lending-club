## Overview

Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending company founded in 2007 by John Donovan and Renaud Laplanche. The Lending Club platform allows borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000.

From Q1'2007 - Q2'2019, the Lending Club platform originated ~ $38.1 billion in loans, most recently originating ~ $2.2B in Q2'19.

As we can see here, ~85% of Lending Club loans fall under the Fully Paid or Current category, indicating that a sizable chunk of the loans available to investors are performing. To further break these loans down, we can analyze how Lending Club grades loans. 

Lending Club, at loan origination, gives a loan a grade of A to G and a subgrade of 1 to 5 indicating the financial rating of the borrower based on a proprietary model. The model outputs a number ranging from 1 - 25 which is then translated to a grade and a subgrade. For example, a model rank of 6 would correspond to B1. To dive further into how Lending Club loans perform by grade, we have the below plot:
