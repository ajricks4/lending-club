The Lending Club platform allows borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $1,000 and $40,000.

## A First Look

Because we have loans dating back to 2007, we can start by viewing a time series of Lending Club's loans originated per month. The below plot also overlays a plot of the cumulative loan growth as well as Lending Club's stock (NYSE:LC) to see whether loan growth has translated into market capitalization. The below plot also shows (red marker) the date at which Lending Club IPO'ed.

|Year|Amount|
|:---|:-----|
|2015|$6.4B|
|2016|$6.4B|
|2017|$6.6B|
|2018|$7.9B|
|2019|$4.1B|

As we can see here, ~85% of Lending Club loans fall under the Fully Paid or Current category, indicating that a sizable chunk of the loans available to investors are performing. To further break these loans down, we can analyze how Lending Club grades loans. 

Lending Club, at loan origination, gives a loan a grade of A to G and a subgrade of 1 to 5 indicating the financial rating of the borrower based on a proprietary model. The model outputs a number ranging from 1 - 25 which is then translated to a grade and a subgrade. For example, a model rank of 6 would correspond to B1. To dive further into how Lending Club loans perform by grade, we have the below plot:

The exact $ (expressed in millions )values are as follows:
<p align="center">
  
| Grade| Principal Paid Off| Outstanding| Bad Debt|
|:-----|:------------------|:-----------|:--------|
| A    | $5,050.3M         | $2,440.4M  | $146.6M |
| B    | $7,196.7M         | $2,884.8M  | $553.5M |
| C    |$6,896.6M          |$2,801.4M   |$1,047.8M|
| D    |$3,399.7M          |$1,415.8M   |$838.5M  |
| E    |$1,518.0| $338.7M | $561.5M|
| F    |$469.9M|$79.4M|$250.6M|
| G    |$135.3M|$25.8M|$87.1M|

Speficially, we can see that Lending Club does a good job rating its loans, with each consecutive grade slightly producing more bad debt than the previous grade.
